Hello, welcome to my blog. Here, I will be writing about things that are worth sharing.

My name is Elijah, and I am a 3rd-year Computer Science student at AMA.

I am 21 years old, and currently, I am experiencing a major existential crisis.

I love to listen to all kinds of music, and sometimes I share my progress here while coding. Moreover, I also enjoy playing video games, but not the usual games that you usually play.

Thanks for stopping by, cowboy
