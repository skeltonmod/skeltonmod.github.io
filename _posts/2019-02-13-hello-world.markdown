Hello, Welcome to my blog. Here I'll be writing about things that are worth sharing.

My name is Elijah, I am a 3rd year Computer Science student at AMA.

I'm 21 years old and currently experiencing major existential crisis.

I love to listen to all kinds of music, I sometimes code and share my progress here, and I also love to play video games but not the usual games you usually play.

Thanks for stopping by cowboy!
