To some long time readers in my site (skeltonnigga.club), You might have wondered where it went, well it was taken down for "Illegal Activities"
but thankfully I now have enough time to setup a new blog site but instead of using my own crappy blogging framework, I decided to use Jekyll.


Jekyll is a static site generator intended for serverless blogging (If I understood it correctly) that runs on ruby, I use it for github pages at the moment
but soon, I will transfer all the posts and blogs that isn't related to programming to another site, hopefully in the future. 

For now i'll just have to stick with Jekyll since it's easier to maintain than my flask blogsite. I'll maybe try some tricks to get the anime streamer to work
again. Devious Intents never die.


Expect more from this site soon, probably will port my older cringe posts from skeltonnigga.club.
