Recently, a friend of mine from college hit me up with a job opportunity, it's a web developer position at some australian company called **FLIGNO** I looked them up and they look legit. 

Before, I was having double thoughts about applying for the position mainly because of the stack that they're using, which is Laravel and ReactJS, both of which I am really inexperienced with, but you know what they say,
