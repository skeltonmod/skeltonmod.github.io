#### What?

Lately I had this wonderful idea to make a decentralized music app that works just like spotify, but instead of having a central service, it will instead rely on it's users for music; much like napster or limewire but it's written on modern web technologies plus you can use the app to stream music anywhere without using another media player.

#### Why?

During my time being employed, I have noticed my skill isn't really on a professional level. I decided to make this project to cover my exit strategy just in case I don't pass the probationary evaluation.

#### When?

Currently working on it right now during my free time or when I have nothing better to do. I might release a beta build just for my friends so maybe they can try it out and test out the features

#### Roadblocks

While the idea is great, the problem is gonna stem from the publishing side of things, mainly apple. I can't just put it on the app store because it's practically pirating (keyword: p2p), So I might have to make a PWA version of it instead to mitigate the IOS problem, that and I don't own any apple devices so I can't really compile it even if it was something "legal". but for android, I can just build it as APK and be done with it.

I might actually pull this off but my self confidence when making software is diminishing badly, so I might randomly pause on the project.
