> Krishna's "A Servant's Journey to Success" Blogsite is now forever lost


Yesterday while cleaning up my gist repo to make way for my work related stashed codes, I came across an old gist from my site that was intenionally archived just in case both sites would go dark.

I opened the gist and read it for a while and had the sudden urge to revisit the very first iteration of this blog site that you are seeing now, but I have good news and bad news. Good news is the very first iteration is still in my private reposioty, Bad news is that the blog site where I got the idea from is now deactivated by weebly.

I guess she never updated her entries after journal #7 huh... What a sad day. that's probably the last time I'll see from her blog before it disappears in my mind.

The gist'd blog post will be up shortly.
