title: Where am I going?
category: career

Recently, a friend of mine from college hit me up with a job opportunity, it's a web developer position at some australian company called **FLIGNO** I looked them up and they look legit. 

Before, I was having double thoughts about applying for the position mainly because of the stack that they're using, which is Laravel and ReactJS, both of which I am really inexperienced with, but you know what they say

> Living life without risks is barely living at all

I decided to take on the interview and I was asked about my previous career which in hindsight kinda looks like I did a lot but in reality, It was just me coming up with ways to earn money by fixing other people's code and help them stay in their job; an outsource job. It kinda feels hopeless at this point, there are a lot of bugs with my demo project and I'm not even expecting to get the job anymore, they might even scream at me for having such a horrible demo project just like my panelist from manila.

Sometimes, I wondered if my life will atleast be meaningful if I took psychology or accountancy but, even those are too much for me now that I have realised. I'm probably better off working at a grocery store counting stocks and whatnot atleast then I won't have to worry about why I'm never good at anything that I wanted to do, while you can argue that I have made some improvements in my understanding with my current field of studies but, that's all in relative perspective. 

I only have 2 more days left until the interview and I have already wasted my time by doing chores for other people, even if I'm not paid to do their projects (College crushes are really career threatening)
All in the name of doing what I love.

Let's just see if my interviewers like my demo project, if not then that would be totally understandable. **FLIGNO** is a big company from what I have gathered, I might not be even cut out for professional web development.

Thankfully this blogsite's hosting will expire next week, just in time.
